            Our SDKs include a specialized tool, the UaModeler®, 
            which not only simplifies the modeling of information itself, 
            this tool generates the source code required to implement the designed model. 
            The generated code exactly fits into the respective SDK.
            <br>
            The UaModeler provides graphical design of address space, 
            adding nodes and references and finally generates code by pressing a button. 
            Thus it not only speeds up the implementation, it also increases the software 
            quality by producing well structured, error-free code. 
            As implementation is reduced to “modeling and generating” even complex models 
            can be “implemented” very quickly. 
            This tool gives all the SDKs from Unified Automation 
            the lead ahead on the OPC UA toolkit market.
